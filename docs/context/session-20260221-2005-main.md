# Session Summary: 2026-02-21 - main

## Status: Completed

## Goals
- Commit previously-completed stub index pages from the prior session
- Replace all remaining "Content coming soon" stub index pages with proper landing pages
- Verify clean build and push to origin

## Completed

### Committed Prior-Session Work
Two stub pages rewritten in the prior session were uncommitted. These were staged and committed together with the prior session's summary file:
- `docs/docs/getting-started/index.md` - getting-started section landing page
- `docs/docs/getting-started/tutorial/index.md` - tutorial section landing page
- `docs/context/session-20260222-0145-anchor-fixes-and-index-stubs.md` - prior session summary

Commit: `b78c62c` - "Replace getting-started stub index pages with proper landing pages"

### Replaced All 10 Remaining Stub Index Pages
Every "Content coming soon" placeholder across the site was replaced with a proper landing page. Each page follows the same style established by the two prior-session stubs: a short intro paragraph describing the section, bulleted links to sub-pages with em-dash descriptions, and an optional closing sentence suggesting where to start.

Pages written:

1. `docs/docs/language/index.md` - Language Reference, organized into 7 logical subsections (Core, Types, Object Model, Procedural, Advanced, System Library, Web UI) rather than listing all 40+ pages flat
2. `docs/docs/intrinsics/index.md` - Intrinsic Classes and Functions, listing all 8 function sets and all 27 intrinsic classes individually
3. `docs/docs/library/index.md` - Library Guide, organized by functional category (design, core topics, output, extras) rather than nav order
4. `docs/docs/library/actions/index.md` - Actions section (5 articles on verify/check, preconditions, verbs, action results)
5. `docs/docs/library/actors/index.md` - Actors section (4 articles on NPCs, conversation, travel)
6. `docs/docs/library/advanced/index.md` - Advanced Topics (9 articles on command cycle, scope, transcript, etc.)
7. `docs/docs/api/index.md` - API Reference (by-class and by-file auto-generated docs)
8. `docs/docs/vm-spec/index.md` - T3 VM Specification, organized into Overview/Architecture/Reference groupings
9. `docs/docs/tools/index.md` - Tools, organized by function (compiler, running, metadata, IDE, platform-specific)
10. `docs/docs/appendices/index.md` - Appendices (4 supplementary reference articles)

Commit: `ddecfce` - "Replace remaining 10 stub index pages with proper landing pages"

### Build Verification and Push
- `mkdocs build` ran clean with no new warnings
- Both commits pushed to origin main

## Key Decisions

### 1. Grouped Language Reference into 7 Subsections
The language section contains 40+ individual pages. Rather than listing them all flat, the landing page groups them into 7 logical subsections (Core Language, Types and Values, Object Model, Procedural Code, Advanced Features, System Library, Web UI) to give readers a navigable overview. Each subsection bullet links to the first or most representative page in the group.

### 2. Listed Every Intrinsic Class Individually
Unlike the language section, the intrinsics section's 27 classes are each a distinct, self-contained reference page with no further hierarchy. Listing them individually gives the landing page genuine reference value.

### 3. Organized Library Landing by Function Rather Than Nav Order
The adv3 library guide nav ordering is not strictly logical from a reader's perspective. The library landing page groups content into functional categories (game design, core topics, output and formatting, extras) to help readers find what they need faster.

### 4. VM Spec Organized into Three Tiers
The VM spec subsections (overview, architecture, reference) map naturally to depth of engagement: conceptual introduction, structural description, and detailed reference. The landing page makes this progression explicit.

## Open Items

### Short Term
- None. All 12 "Content coming soon" placeholders across the site are now proper landing pages.

### Long Term
- Site-wide anchor link verification (identified in prior session as potential future work)
- CI linting for dead internal links to prevent regressions

**Session records** (1 file):
- `docs/context/session-20260222-0145-anchor-fixes-and-index-stubs.md` - Prior session summary (committed from prior session)

## Architectural Notes

All 12 landing pages follow a consistent style pattern:
- Opening paragraph: one to two sentences describing what the section covers and who it is for
- Bulleted links: `[Page Title](path/) — brief description of the page's purpose`
- Optional closing sentence: recommends a starting point for readers new to the section

This pattern was already established by the two prior-session stubs and is maintained throughout for visual and structural consistency across the site.

The approach of using two parallel explore agents to gather nav structure and H1 titles across all 10 sections simultaneously made it possible to write all 10 pages in a single batch without repeated back-and-forth lookups.

## Notes

**Session duration**: ~1 hour

**Approach**: Parallel exploration of mkdocs nav structure and sub-page H1 titles across all 10 sections, followed by batch authoring of all 10 landing pages in a single pass matching the established stub style.
