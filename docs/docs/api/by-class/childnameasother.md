# ChildNameAsOther

*class* — defined in [en_us.t](../by-file/en_us.t.md) (line 2076)


ChildNameAsOther is a mix-in class that can be used with NameAsOther to add the various childInXxx naming to the mapped properties. The childInXxx names are the names generated when another object is described as located within this object; by mapping these properties to our target object, we ensure that we use exactly the same phrasing as we would if the contained object were actually contained by our target rather than by us.
