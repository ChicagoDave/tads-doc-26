*class* — defined in [objects.t](../by-file/objects.t.md) (line 983)


Collective - this is an object that can be used to refer to a group of other (usually equivalent) objects collectively. In most cases, this object will be a separate game object that contains or can contain the individuals: a bag of marbles can be a collective for the marbles, or a book of matches can be a collective for the matchsticks.
