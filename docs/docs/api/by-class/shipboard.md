# Shipboard

*class* — defined in [travel.t](../by-file/travel.t.md) (line 4768)


A shipboard room. This is a simple mix-in class: it can be used along with any type of Room to indicate that this room is aboard a ship. When a room is aboard a ship, the shipboard travel directions (port, starboard, fore, aft) are allowed; these directions normally make no sense.
