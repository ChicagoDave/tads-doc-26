## Properties


### `actionAllowsAll`

Defined in action.t, line 3669

Does this action allow "all" to be used in noun phrases? By default, we allow it or not according to a gameMain property.


### `actionDobjProp`

Defined in action.t, line 3620


### `actor_` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3786

target actor


### `askDobjResponseProd`

Defined in action.t, line 3221

The root production to use to parse missing direct object responses. By default, this is nounList, but individual actions can override this as appropriate.


### `checkDobjProp`

Defined in action.t, line 3619


### `dobjCur_`

Defined in action.t, line 3745

The resolved direct object on which we're currently executing the command. To execute the command, we iterate through the direct object list, calling the execution sequence for each object in the list. We set this to the current object in each iteration.


### `dobjInfoCur_`

Defined in action.t, line 3748

the full ResolveInfo associated with dobjCur_


### `dobjList_`

Defined in action.t, line 3737

my resolved list of direct objects


### `dobjMatch`

Defined in action.t, line 3734

the predicate must assign the direct object production tree here


### `dobjResolver_`

Defined in action.t, line 3751

my cached direct object resolver


### `issuer_` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3783

issuing actor


### `preCondDobjProp`

Defined in action.t, line 3617


### `predicateNounPhrases` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3269

a transitive action has one noun phrase: the direct object


### `remapDobjProp`

Defined in action.t, line 3618


### `verDobjProp`

Defined in action.t, line 3616

The direct object preconditions, verifier, remapper, check, and action methods for this action. Each concrete action must define these appropriately. By convention, the methods are named like so:


### `whichMessageObject` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3795

By default, our direct object plays the direct object role in generated messages. Subclasses can override this if the resolved object is to play a different role. Note that this only affects generated messages; for parsing purposes, our object is always in the DirectObject role.

## Methods


### `adjustDefaultObjectPrep(prep, obj)`

Defined in en_us.t, line 8466

Adjust the preposition. In some cases, the verb will want to vary the preposition according to the object. This method can return a custom preposition in place of the one in the verbPhrase. By default, we just use the fixed preposition from the verbPhrase, which is passed in to us in 'prep'.


### `announceAllDefaultObjects(allResolved)` *(overridden)*

Defined in en_us.t, line 8469

announce all defaulted objects


### `announceDefaultObject(obj, whichObj, resolvedAllObjects)` *(overridden)*

Defined in en_us.t, line 8434

announce a default object used with this action


### `canDobjResolveTo(obj)`

Defined in action.t, line 3241

Can the direct object potentially resolve to the given simulation object? This only determines if the object is a *syntactic* match, meaning that it can match at a vocabulary and grammar level. This doesn't test it for logicalness or check that it's an otherwise valid resolution.


### `checkAction` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3555

Check the command.


### `checkRemapping` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3531

Check for remapping


### `construct` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3067


### `createDobjResolver(issuingActor, targetActor)`

Defined in action.t, line 3651

Create a resolver for the direct object. By default, we are our own resolver. Some actions might want to override this to create and return a specialized resolver instance if special resolution rules are needed.


### `createForMissingDobj(orig, asker)`

Defined in action.t, line 3182

Create an instance of this action for retrying a given single-object action with a missing direct object.


### `createForRetry(orig)`

Defined in action.t, line 3085

Create an action for retrying an original action with changes.


### `doActionMain`

Defined in action.t, line 3431

Execute the action. We'll run through the execution sequence once for each resolved direct object.


### `execAction` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3584

Execute the command.


### `filterAmbiguousDobj(lst, requiredNum, np)`

Defined in action.t, line 3683

filter an ambiguous direct object noun phrase


### `filterPluralDobj(lst, np)`

Defined in action.t, line 3692

filter a plural phrase


### `getAllDobj(actor, scopeList)`

Defined in action.t, line 3677

Resolve 'all' for the direct object, given a list of everything in scope. By default, we'll simply return everything in scope; some actions might want to override this to return a more specific list of objects suitable for 'all'.


### `getCurrentObjects` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3484

Get the list of active objects. We have only a direct object, so we'll return a list with the current direct object.


### `getDefaultDobj(np, resolver)`

Defined in action.t, line 3700

get the default direct object


### `getDobj`

Defined in action.t, line 3708

get the current direct object of the command


### `getDobjCount`

Defined in action.t, line 3717

get the number of direct objects


### `getDobjFlags`

Defined in action.t, line 3714

get the object resolution flags for the direct object


### `getDobjInfo`

Defined in action.t, line 3711

get the full ResolveInfo associated with the current direct object


### `getDobjResolver(issuingActor, targetActor, reset)`

Defined in action.t, line 3631

Get my direct object resolver. If I don't already have one, create one and cache it; if I've already cached one, return it. Note that we cache the resolver because it can sometimes take a bit of work to set one up (the scope list can in some cases be complicated to calculate). We use the resolver only during the object resolution phase; since game state can't change during this phase, it's safe to keep a cached copy.


### `getDobjTokens`

Defined in action.t, line 3720

get the original token list of the current direct object phrase


### `getDobjWords`

Defined in action.t, line 3727

get the original words (as a list of strings) of the current dobj


### `getMatchForRole(role)` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3286

get the match tree for the noun phrase in the given role


### `getMessageParam(objName)` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3413

Get a message parameter object for the action. We define 'dobj' as the direct object, in addition to any inherited targets.


### `getObjectForRole(role)` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3279

get the resolved object in a given role


### `getObjResponseProd(resolver)` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3224

get the missing object response production for a given role


### `getPreCondDescList` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3469

get the precondition descriptor list for the action


### `getPreCondPropForRole(role)` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3299

get the 'preCond' property for a given object role


### `getQuestionInf(which)` *(overridden)*

Defined in en_us.t, line 8476

show the verb's basic infinitive form for an interrogative


### `getRemapPropForRole(role)` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3305

get the 'remap' property for a given object role


### `getResolvedDobjList`

Defined in action.t, line 3351

get the list of resolved direct objects


### `getResolvedObjList(which)` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3344

get the list of resolved objects in the given role


### `getResolveInfo(obj, oldRole)` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3311

get the ResolveInfo for the given object


### `getRoleFromIndex(idx)` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3272

get the role of an object


### `getVerbPhrase(inf, ctx)` *(overridden)*

Defined in en_us.t, line 8492

get the verb phrase in infinitive or participle form


### `getVerbPhrase1(inf, vp, dobjText, dobjIsPronoun)`

Defined in en_us.t, line 8534

Given the text of the direct object phrase, build the verb phrase for a one-object verb. This is a class method that can be used by other kinds of verbs (i.e., non-TActions) that use phrasing like a single object.


### `getVerifyPropForRole(role)` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3293

get the 'verify' property for a given object role


### `initForMissingDobj(orig)`

Defined in action.t, line 3209

Initialize this action in preparation for retrying with a missing direct object. This routine must copy any phrases from the original action that have already been resolved. This base TAction implementation obviously can't have anything pre-resolved in the original, since the original must simply be an IAction. Subclasses must override as appropriate for the kinds of base actions from which they can be retried.


### `initResolver(issuingActor, targetActor)`

Defined in action.t, line 3769

Initialize me as a resolver.


### `initTentative(issuingActor, targetActor, whichObj)` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3520

initialize tentative resolutions for other noun phrases


### `resetAction` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3073

inherit only the Action constructor


### `resolvedObjectsInScope` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3402

check that the resolved objects are in scope


### `resolveNouns(issuingActor, targetActor, results)`

Defined in action.t, line 3253

Resolve objects. This is called at the start of command execution to resolve noun phrases in the command to specific objects.


### `retryWithAmbiguousDobj(orig, objs, asker, objPhrase)`

Defined in action.t, line 3138

Retry an action as a single-object action with an ambiguous direct object. We'll ask which of the given possible objects is intended.


### `retryWithMissingDobj(orig, asker)`

Defined in action.t, line 3127

Retry an intransitive action as a single-object action. We'll obtain a indirect object using the normal means (first looking for a default, then prompting the player if we can't find a suitable default). 'orig' is the original zero-object action.


### `setCurrentObjects(lst)` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3490

set the current objects


### `setObjectMatches(dobj)` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3389

manually set the unresolved object noun phrase match trees


### `setResolvedDobj(dobj)`

Defined in action.t, line 3368

set the resolved direct object


### `setResolvedObjects(dobj)` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3361

manually set the resolved objects - we'll set the direct object


### `testRetryDefaultDobj(orig)`

Defined in action.t, line 3164

Test to see if askForDobj() would find a default direct object. Returns true if there's a default, nil if not. If this returns true, then askForDobj() will simply take the default and proceed; otherwise, it will have to actually ask the user for the missing information.


### `verifyAction` *(overridden)*

Defined in action.t, line 3499

Verify the action.


### `whatObj(which)` *(overridden)*

Defined in en_us.t, line 8423

return an interrogative word for an object of the action
