*object* — defined in [output.t](../by-file/output.t.md) (line 915)


<.announceObj> - style for object announcement messages. The parser shows an object announcement for each object when a command is applied to multiple objects (TAKE ALL, DROP KEYS AND WALLET). The announcement simply shows the object's name and a colon, to let the player know that the response text that follows applies to the announced object.
