# Part VI: The User Interface


This part covers the TADS 3 interpreter's user interface.  TADS 3
provides a powerful set of UI features.  The UI is naturally focused
on the needs of traditional text-only Interactive Fiction, but goes
beyond the limits of text-only games to provide graphics, sound
effects, and GUI-style interaction on platforms that support these
features.
