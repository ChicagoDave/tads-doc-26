# Unthing Template

For an Unthing we normally want to define the notHereMsg property rather than the desc property; along with trying to do anything else to or with an Unthing, examining an Unthing displays its notHereMsg, not its description.

```tads3
Unthing template 'vocabWords' 'name' @location? 'notHereMsg'?;
```
