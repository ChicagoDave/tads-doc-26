# Changes for v3.0.8

The ShipboardRoom class renamed [Shipboard](shipboardroom.md).

The custom TardisRoom class is no longer used in the sample game, since it is identical to the new [ShipboardRoom](lockablewithkey.md).

Added a slightly fuller explanation (or rather, warning against abuse of) the locationList property of [MultiLoc](multiloc.md).

Added to the explanation of [roomParts](roomparts.md), specifically in relation to changing or moving them dynamically during the course of a game.

Added an explanation of the new specialTopicHistory object to the description of [SpecialTopic](specialtopic.md).

Changed the [gameMain](startupcodegamemain.md) definition to use the new setAboutBox() method.

Added a brief explanation of the new [gameMain](startupcodegamemain.md) property allVerbsAllowAll.

Amended the final couple of paragraphs in the description of [ComplexContainer](complexcontainer.md)to take account of new features (specifically the remapping of isOpen, isLocked, makeOpen and makeLocked to the subContainer).

Amended the definition of the custom [RedCandle](candle.md) class to fix an obscure bug in the sample game.

Added a new section on [Occluder](occluder.md).

Corrected a number of typos.
