# ShuffledEventList Template

A shuffled event list with two lists - the first list is the sequential initial list, fired in the exact order specified; and the second is the random list, with the events that occur in shuffled order after we exhaust the initial list.

`ShuffledEventList template [firstEvents] [eventList];`
