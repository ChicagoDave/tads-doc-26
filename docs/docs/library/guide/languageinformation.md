# Language Information

This Guide has made no systematic attempt to describe the TADS 3 language. Most of the language features of TADS 3 are well documented in the [*System Manual*](../../language/index.md) that comes with the standard distribution of the TADS 3 Author's Kit. If for any reason you do not have this (perhaps because you are not using the Windows version of TADS 3) you can download it from  [http://www.tads.org](http://www.tads.org)
