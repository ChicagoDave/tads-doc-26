# Defining Verbs

Although this Guide has given a number of examples of defining verbs in TADS 3, no attempt has been made to treat this topic in a systematic fashion.

For more information on defining your own verbs in TADS 3, consult the sections in the *Technical Manual*  on '[How to Create Verbs](../actions/creating-verbs.md)', along with articles on '[Action Results](../actions/action-results.md)' and '[Good use of verify() and check()](../actions/verify-check.md)'. See also the discussion on 'Controlling the Action' in Section 4 of Chapter Five of *Getting Started in TADS 3*, and on defining CrossAction in Chapter Six of *Getting Started*.
