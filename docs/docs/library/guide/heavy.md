A Heavy object is one that is too heavy for the player character to lift or move, such a piece of heavy furniture:

```tads3
cabinDesk : Heavy 'large solid oak desk' 'desk' @greatCabin
  "It's a large, solid oak desk. A button is fixed underneath it. "

We shall be doing more things with this desk in due course.
