# Changes for v3.0.12

Added a note emphasizing that [Lockable](lockable.md), [LockableWithKey](lockablewithkey.md) and [IndirectLockable](indirectlockable.md) need to precede Thing-derived classes in the superclass list of an object declaration.

Amended the [DeadEndConnector](deadendconnectortemplate.md) template in accordance with its change in TADs 3.0.12.

Added a brief discussion of the new IFID field on [versionInfo](startupcodegamemain.md#versioninfo).

Added a short section on the new [ActorByeTopic](actorbyetopic.md) class.

Removed the sections on the inputManager and the mainOutputStream, since these substance of these has been moved to a new article on [Some Common Input/Output Issues<-- /AHref --> in the *Technical Manual*.](../input-output.md)
